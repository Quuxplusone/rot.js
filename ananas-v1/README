This is Ondřej Žára's example game "Ananas aus Caracas" as described in

http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Rot.js_tutorial

except that I've completely reworked the game engine to use
Bob Nystrom's approach to game loops as described in

http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/07/15/a-turn-based-game-loop/

The CSS styles are shamelessly copied from one of Ondřej's
actually polished games, "The Royal Wedding".

To demonstrate some of the new features, I've replaced the
antagonist Pedro with a family of three grid bugs.
