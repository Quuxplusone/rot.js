This is ananas-v1 (see that README), plus an interactive command line.

Entering commands such as NORTHWEST or OPEN BOX on the command line
in the lower pane causes the player-character to execute those actions
in the upper pane.

At any point, you can QUIT or RESTART a game by typing those commands
into the lower pane.
